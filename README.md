# The Opioid Crisis and its Patterns

The opioid crisis is massive in America and affects people daily. It is essential to understand it as much as possible to help prevent it and help people deal with the harm that it causes. Not only people with substance use are affected, but also almost one-third of US adults know someone or will know someone who has died of opioids. (JAMA Health Forum) This project will analyze different data types to see patterns and see where prevention would matter most. 

The opioid crisis is at an all-time high and needs to be addressed as soon as possible. While some solutions like education programs and data sharing have helped, more work still needs to be done because this crisis is taking 220 lives per day! This research is aimed to try and identify if other areas can be targeted to help ensure that the number of overdoses starts decreasing over time. The goal of using data mining techniques is to see if there are any noticeable patterns in these data sets and determine if steps can be taken to protect the community from these dangerous, addictive drugs. By identifying these trends, we hope to inform policymakers, healthcare providers, and social services on how to allocate resources effectively
